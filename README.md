# Building Robust Neuroscience Experiments with Python and PsychoPy

## Welcome
This is the repository for a three-day online workshop on building robust neuroscience experiments in Python using the PsychoPy package.
We are going to leverage modern software engineering tools like automated testing, data validation and continuous integration to create robust applications that work exactly as intended. An example of such an application can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/OleBialas/posner_task).

Each day consists of four units, each of those units centers on a particular topic surrounding building experiments. Here is a brief outline of the days and topics:
